This action heist game gives you the chance to retrieve looted artifacts in museums that were stolen from their rightful owners during colonization periods centuries ago. Break in with style as you glide your way through with roller skates and a paintball gun!

With the objective of creating a dynamic and fast-paced gameplay, my main goal was to create a movement for the character that feels fun and is easy to learn, but hard to master. Along with it, a simple main objective, interesting level designs and museum guards to dodge or defeat also contributes to the experience by giving a purpose to the character movement.

Each level comes with a main objective, secondary missions and a unique level design. The game encourages replayability with incentives like speedrun records and character skins, which can be unlocked by completing missions.

Contributions:
- Movement: Rigidbody and physics adjustments for smooth roller skating. More code below.
- Enemies: Nav Mesh AIs with different attack and health stats, patterns for movement and behaviour, like long range attacks, for example.
- Level objectives: Each level has secondary missions with different criterias for completion.
- UI and feedback: UI Animators with transitions, camera effects (screen shake, damage, tricks) and Particle Systems for various actions (drift, successful/unsuccessful tricks, paintballs, stolen pieces).
- Audio management: Volume adjustments, audio mixers and adaptive effects to music.
- Keyboard and Gamepad support: Use of the "new" Input System to adapt game for different platforms.
